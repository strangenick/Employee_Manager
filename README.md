# Employee_Manager
User can load employees from a text file, print their information to the console, enter hours worked (same for each employee), and print the subsequent paychecks. bb_moreEmployees is a version that allows for a text file containing any number of employees. bb_editHours is a version that allows the user to enter hours for individual employees.
